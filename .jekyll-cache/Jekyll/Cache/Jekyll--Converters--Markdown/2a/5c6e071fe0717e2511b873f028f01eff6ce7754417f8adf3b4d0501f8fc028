<p>I was born in the 8-bit era and grew up with a 128Kb spectrum and then an AMIGA 500. 
I learned to program BASIC at the age of 12 and sudenly I was playing arcade games, SNES and Megadrive until I went to college to study computer science in the 90s: learnt Assembler, C, C ++, JAVA or SQL and the uberunknown Linux!. The first distro I installed was a Slackware!
I have worked in companies such as Sun Microsystems, Informix software or Ascential until I went to the public sector in 2002. I currently work for the CESGA (Galician Supercomputing Center) for more than 15 years.
I like to read, walk and enjoy a good day with my family and kids. Learning is in my DNA, and as a geek i value technology as a tool to improve our lives and change the world.</p>

<p><strong>1994-1999: BSc, Computer Science Engineering, Deusto University</strong>
Final Degree Project: Developed a front-end interface written in tcl/tk for the debian package manager (dpkg). It used the alien tool (https://joeyh.name/code/alien/) to convert packages between formats (.tgz, .rpm, .deb).</p>

<p><strong>2004-2007 Postgraduate Diploma/MSc in Data engineering</strong>
<strong>Computer Science Joint PhD Programme</strong>

Project MORFEO: Designed and implemented a datawarehouse for storing and analyzing data from patients with Cardio-Respiratory Sleep Disorders. I had to deal with different types of data, from basic tests like a Glasgow Scale to binary files from a polysomnography and came up with a design based on Kimball’s approach to analyze and study all the data in an OLAP way using Oracle 10g, with the possibility of using datamining techniques.</p>
